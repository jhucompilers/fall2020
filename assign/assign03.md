title: "Assignment 3: Compiler front end, semantic analysis"
---

*This assignment description is fairly complete, but is likely to be updated with additional information*

**Due**: TBD

Points: This assignment is worth 150 points

# Overview

In this assignment, you will build a front end (lexical analyzer and parser) for a
simple [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language))-like programming
language, and a *semantic analysis* phase that builds symbol tables representing the
data types and storage requirements for each program construct that requires them.

One of the main things you will create in this assignment is an AST-based intermediate
representation to represent the source program.

The programming language that your compiler will support, and this assignment,
are both heavily inspired by/stolen from
[Peter Fr√∂hlich's spring 2018 compilers course](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phf/2018/spring/cs328/).

## Grading criteria

The grading criteria are as follows:

* Packaging: 5%
* Design and coding style: 10% (see expectations for [design, coding style, and efficiency](design.html))
* Functional requirements: 85%

# Getting started

Download [assign03.zip](assign03.zip).

The starter code is similar to that provided for [Assignment 2](assign02.html), but note that there are some significant changes:

* A lexical analyzer (`lex.l`) is provided; you will just need to implement a parser (`parse.y`)
* The `Node` type is now a C++ class, fully defined in the `node.h` header file; the C functions used in previous assignments are provided for backwards-compatilibility
* The `Node` type has some commented-out code showing one possible way of allowing AST nodes to be annotated with a symbol table entry (pointer to `Symbol`) or a type (pointer to `Type`)
* The `ast.h` and `ast.cpp` source files show a reasonable way to implement ASTs for the source language, and include support for printing ASTs textually or in [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) format
* The `astvisitor.h` and `astvisitor.cpp` source files implement the visitor design pattern for ASTs
* The `context.h` and `context.cpp` source files are intended to collect all of the data structures used in the compilation process
* The main function is now in a C++ module, `main.cpp`, and has support for handling command line options (you can probably use this as-is)

Note that you may freely use any of the starter code, but you are not obligated to use it, and you are free to make any changes that you feel would be helpful.  For example, if you would like to use different AST node types, you can modify `ast.h`/`ast.cpp` and `astvisitor.h`/`astvisitor.cpp`.

# Language specification

## Lexical structure

The language has the following kinds of tokens:

* Keywords: `PROGRAM` `BEGIN` `END` `CONST` `TYPE` `VAR` `ARRAY` `OF` `RECORD` `IF` `THEN` `ELSE` `REPEAT` `UNTIL` `WHILE` `DO` `READ` `WRITE`
* Operators: `:=` `=` `+` `-` `*` `DIV` `MOD` `#` `<` `>` `<=` `:=`
* Brackets/grouping: `(` `)` `[` `]`
* Misc/punctuation:  `:` `;` `.`
* Identifers: a letter or underscore (`_`), followed by 0 or more letters, underscores, and/or digits
* Integer literals: a sequence of one or more digit characters

Tokens may be separated by whitespace.

## Syntax

The overall input is a *program*, which has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
PROGRAM <i>identifier</i> ; <i>opt-declarations</i> BEGIN <i>opt-instructions</i> END .
</pre></div>

*opt-declarations* is a sequence of 0 or more *declaration*s.

*opt-instructions* is a sequence of 0 or more *instruction*s.

### Declarations and types

A *declaration* is a *const-declaration*, *var-declaration*, or *type-declaration*.

A *const-declaration* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
CONST <i>const-definitions</i>
</pre></div>

*const-definitions* is a sequence of one or more occurrences of *const-definition*.

A *const-definition* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>identifier</i> = <i>expression</i> ;
</pre></div>

A *var-declaration* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
VAR <i>var-definitions</i>
</pre></div>

*var-definitions* is a sequence of one or more occurrences of *var-definition*.

A *var-definition* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>identifier-list</i> : <i>type</i> ;
</pre></div>

An *identifier-list* is a sequence of 1 or more identifiers, separated by commas (`,`).

A *type-declaration* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
TYPE <i>type-definitions</i>
</pre></div>

*type-definitions* is a sequence of one or more occurrences of *type-definition*.

A *type-definition* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>identifier</i> = <i>type</i> ;
</pre></div>

A *type* is a *named-type*, *array-type*, or *record-type*.

A *named-type* is simply an *identifier*.

An *array-type* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
ARRAY <i>expression</i> OF <i>type</i>
</pre></div>

A *record-type* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
RECORD <i>var-definitions</i> END
</pre></div>

### Expressions

A *primary-expression* is an integer literal, *designator*, or parenthesized expression.

A *unary-expression* is either a *primary-expression*, or a *unary-expression* preceded by either `-` or `+`.

The following infix operators may be used in expressions, with the operands being *unary-expression*s:

Operator          | Precedence | Associativity
----------------- | ---------- | -------------
`+`, `-`          | lower      | left
`*`, `DIV`, `MOD` | higher     | left

Note that relational operators may *not* appear in *expression*s.  (They are only used in *condition*s.)

### Instructions

An *instruction* is an *assignment-statement*, *if-statement*, *repeat-statement*, *while-statement*,
*read-statement*, or *write-statement*.  Each *instruction* must be followed by a semicolon (`;`).

An *assignment-statement* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>designator</i> := <i>expression</i>
</pre></div>

An *if-statement* can have either of the following forms:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
IF <i>condition</i> THEN <i>opt-instructions</i> END
</pre></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
IF <i>condition</i> THEN <i>opt-instructions</i> ELSE <i>opt-instructions</i> END
</pre></div>

A *repeat-statement* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
REPEAT <i>opt-instructions</i> UNTIL <i>condition</i> END
</pre></div>

A *while-statement* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
WHILE <i>condition</i> DO <i>opt-instructions</i> END
</pre></div>

A *write-statement* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
WRITE <i>expression</i>
</pre></div>

A *read-statement* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
READ <i>designator</i>
</pre></div>

A *condition* has the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>expression</i> <i>relational-op</i> <i>expression</i>
</pre></div>

where *relational-op* is one of `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=`, or `#` (not equals).

A *designator* has one of the following forms:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>identifier</i>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>designator</i> [ <i>expression-list</i> ]
</pre></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>designator</i> . <i>identifier</i>
</pre></div>

These three forms of designators correspond to variable references, array element
references, and record field references, respectively.

An <i>expression-list</i> is a sequence of one or more *expression*s, separated by commas (`,`).

## Semantics, type checking

The source language is a [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language))-like
imperative programming language.

There are two primitive data types, `INTEGER` and `CHAR`. These are the *integral* types.

The two kinds of composite data types are arrays and records.  An array type specifies an integer size and an element type, which can be an arbitrary type.  A record type consists of fields, each of which has a name and type.

The operands of numeric operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `DIV`, etc.) must be integral.  Mixed type expressions (consisting of one `INTEGER` and one `CHAR`) are allowed, and the result of a mixed type expression is `INTEGER`.  For non-mixed expressions, the result type is the same as the operand types.

The operands of comparison operators (`<`, `>`, etc.) must be integral.

Integer literals have type `INTEGER`.

Variable references have the type specified by the corresponding variable declaration.

For an array subscript reference, the designator must have an array type, and the expression(s) designating the index(es) must have an integral type (`INTEGER` or `CHAR`.) The type of the subscript reference is the array type's element type.

For a field reference, the designator must have a record type, and the type of the field reference is the type of the field named by the identifier on the right hand side of the `.`.

`WRITE` statements are used for output, and the expression specifying the value to output must be either `INTEGER`, `CHAR`, or array of `CHAR` (any length).

`READ` statements are used for input, and the designator specifying the variable where the input should be stored must be either `INTEGER`, `CHAR`, or array of `CHAR`.

## Errors

Your compiler must do semantic analysis of the input to ensure that each name used in the program refers to a valid type or variable, that array element and field references refer are valid, and that the type rules are followed.

If a semantic error is found, the compiler should print (to `stderr` or `std::cerr`) a message of the form

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre>
<i>sourcefile</i>:<i>line</i>:<i>col</i>: Error: <i>message</i>
</pre></div>

where <i>sourcefile</i> is the name of the input file, <i>line</i> is the source line number of the invalid construct, and <i>col</i> is the source column number of the invalid construct.

Examples of errors that should be reported include:

* Use of a named type that is not defined
* Use of an undefined variable
* Attempt to use the array subscript operator on something that is not an array
* Using a non-integral value as an array index
* Attempting to access a field of something that is not a record type
* Attempting to access a nonexistent field of a record
* Using a non-integral value as an operand to a binary operator
* Using a non-constant value in a constant expression (e.g., in a `CONST` declaration or as an array size)
* Attempting a division by 0 (either using `DIV` or `MOD`) in a constant expression

# Hints, specifications, and advice

## Approach

Rough outline:

* Implement lexical analyzer and parser using flex and bison
* Add semantic actions in the parser to build an AST
* Create an object-based representation of types
* Implement a traversal of the AST to build symbol table entries and do type checking

## Testing

Tests can be found in the following repository: <https://github.com/jhucompilers/fall2020-tests>, in the `assign03` subdirectory.

Set the `ASSIGN03_DIR` environment variable to the name of the directory containing your project.  For example, if your project is in the `git/assign03` subdirectory of your home directory, use the command

```bash
export ASSIGN03_DIR=$HOME/git/assign03
```

TOOD: more information about available tests, running them.

# Submitting

To submit, create a zipfile containing all of the files needed to compile your program.  Suggested commands:

```bash
make clean
zip -9r solution.zip Makefile *.h *.c *.y *.l *.cpp *.rb
```

The suggested command would create a zipfile called `solution.zip`.  Note that if your solution uses C exclusively, you can omit `*.cpp` from the filename patterns.  If you used the `scan_grammar_symbols.rb` script, them make sure you include the `*.rb` pattern as shown above.

Upload your submission to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).  If you are registered for 601.428, upload to **Assign03&#95;428**.  If you are registered for 601.628, upload to **Assign03&#95;628**.
